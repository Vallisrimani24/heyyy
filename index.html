    <h2>You got it. Congrats 🎉🎆</h2> 
    <p>I know you might be busy with work, and I truly understand that. But I want to share something from my side...</p>
    <p>I’ve never been like that — not before, not now. Even on my busiest days, I would put my work aside the moment you needed me — even if it was just for a few minutes.</p>
    <p>Over time, I started noticing that you mostly come to me when you have no work… or when you're bored. And maybe I’m wrong — I really hope I am — but deep down, I don’t feel that I am.</p> 
    <p>I’m not expecting replies anymore, or for things to go back to how they used to be. Maybe my words have felt uninteresting lately, but that’s only because it hurt… to feel ignored and only remembered when convenient. That’s why I sometimes act like I’m not interested 🥺😑.</p>
    <button class="buttons fourth-btn" onclick="openNextContainer('fifth-msg')">Next →</button>

  <div class="container fifth-msg">
    <h2>Sorry... if these messages felt boring or too much 😌</h2>
    <p>I used to check my phone every few seconds... hoping I’d see a notification from you. But most of the time — there was nothing 😑.</p>
    <p>And it’s okay. Really. I get it. Maybe you’re busy. Maybe things changed. I’m trying to understand.</p>
    <p>😭😭😭</p>
    <p>The truth is... when I feel ignored, I get hurt. And in that hurt, I sometimes act angry. You might not understand that part — and maybe you believe it's not your fault 🥱🫤.</p>
    <p>You may even ask, “Then why didn’t you text first?” The answer? Because when I do, the replies often come so late... that it feels like I don’t even matter. Waiting hours… feeling like nothing… it's painful 🥺😖🙁. And honestly — that's how it’s been, minute by minute.</p>
    <button class="buttons fifth-btn" onclick="openNextContainer('sixth-msg')">Next →</button>

    <h2>One Tiny Test… 🌍💫</h2>
    <p>This one’s special. Think carefully.</p>

    <h2>🧐🫢</h2>
    <p>When I felt ignored, I’d tell myself to avoid you — just like you seemed to avoid me. But the moment I saw even a single message from you... I’d melt in seconds. I would reply — pretending to be angry — but deep inside, I was happy that you remembered me. 😖😊</p>
    <p>Believe it or not, there’s so much I want to say… but for some reason, I just can’t. I don’t even know why.</p>
    <p>Even while doing my tasks, my mind would be lost — thinking about the texts I was hoping for… craving for.   I’m not saying you should have texted me… I’m just sharing what’s been going on in my heart.</p>
    <p>I waited... and waited... and waited. But slowly, I’ve come to accept that I won’t receive those messages anymore. That’s why I wanted to express all this to you — but I couldn’t say it directly. So... I made this instead.</p>
    <p>I may not be as good as you in many things… but this… this little thing — I made just for you. 🧡</p>

    <h2>Current face 🥺</h2>
    <p>I started making this around 8 PM… and now, it’s done. Even while working on it, my eyes were filling with tears 💯💯💯</p>
    <p>Maybe someday in the future, we’ll both look back at these messages and think — "how silly, how crazy this all was."</p>
    <p>But right now… this is how I truly feel. And have been feeling… for many days. I just wanted you to know what’s really going on inside me.</p>

    <h2>Congratulations on making it through… 💫💖</h2>
    <h2>This is the final card — maybe you're a little happy it’s over? 😂</h2>
    <p>I know I’ve shared a lot — thoughts, emotions, even anger…  and most of it came from a place of feeling ignored, avoided…  or just missing the connection we once had.</p>
    <p>You might have thought I was lost in my projects. But honestly… I wasn’t. I was waiting. Just waiting… for a message. For presence.</p>
    <p>That’s it. No expectations anymore. Just shared what my heart held for so long.</p>
    <p>So now — stay happy, always. Good luck with everything. And… Byeee 😖.....</p>
    <p>Missing your presence... always 🫴🏾🫂🤍🐭➿</p>
